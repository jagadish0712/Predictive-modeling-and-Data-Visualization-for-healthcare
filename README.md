## Introduction

In the realm of healthcare, predictive analytics plays a pivotal role in forecasting patient outcomes and improving operational efficiency. This project employs predictive modeling to assess health indicators and predict diabetes progression, complemented by data visualization to interpret complex datasets effectively.

## Dataset

The analysis utilizes the `diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015` dataset, which comprises various health indicators collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 survey. The dataset includes features such as:

- Demographic information
- Lifestyle choices
- Medical history
- Physical measurements

## Methodology

The project encompasses the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes outcomes.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive plots to elucidate findings and support decision-making.

## Installation

To replicate this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jagadish0712/Predictive-modeling-and-Data-Visualization-for-healthcare.git
